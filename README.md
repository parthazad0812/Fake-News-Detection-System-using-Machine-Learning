ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Fake News Detection System is an NLP-based machine learning project that classifies news articles as real or fake.
It leverages text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree) to achieve high accuracy in detecting misinformation.

ðŸš€ Features
Text Preprocessing: Removal of punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.

Vectorization: TF-IDF for feature extraction.

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Dataset Handling: Support for large datasets in CSV format.

Visualization: Confusion matrix and accuracy plots.
