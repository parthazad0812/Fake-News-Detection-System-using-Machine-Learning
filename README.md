This Fake News Detection System is a Python-based project designed to classify news articles as real or fake. It employs machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess textual data, extract features, and train a classification model. The project provides an end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to making predictions.

Features
Text Preprocessing:

Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
Conversion of text to lowercase.
Feature Extraction:

Vectorization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical form.
Machine Learning Model:

Logistic Regression is used for training the model and classifying news.
Prediction Interface:

Command-line interface for entering news headlines/articles and getting predictions.
Dataset
The model is trained and tested using the Fake News Dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled news data.

Columns:
title: News headline.
text: Full news content.
label: Binary value (1 for real news, 0 for fake news).
You can download the dataset from Kaggle or use your dataset.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
NLP: nltk, sklearn
